      <p>Please note that the answers given below to frequently asked questions are not designed to take the place of your Academic Advisor. Also be aware that exceptions may be made for special circumstances. Please feel free to <span style="color: blue;"> contact</span> your <a href="/advisors/academic.html">Academic Advisor</a> with any questions you may have.</p> 
      <div class="nota-bene"> 
       <h3 class="highlight">Who?</h3> 
       <h5>Who's my Advisor and how can I meet with him or her?</h5> 
       <div class="xpander"> 
        <p>You can find the name of your academic advisor by checking on the Enrollment/Registration page of <a href="http://www.Rweb.ucr.edu" target="_blank">R'Web</a>.

       </div> 
       <h5>Who do I contact if I'm having a problem with my advisor?</h5> 
       <div class="xpander"> 
        <p>If you are having difficulty with your academic advisor, please contact the CNAS UAAC Director (<a style="color: blue;" href="mailto:barbra.wallace@ucr.edu">email: Barbra Wallace</a>).</p> 
       </div> 
       <h5>Who do I contact if I'm having a problem with my instructor?</h5> 
       <div class="xpander"> 
        <p>Students who have disagreements with their Teaching Assistant should talk with their faculty instructor.&nbsp; Students who have disagreements with their faculty instructor may talk to the Chair of the Department that employs the faculty member.&nbsp; Students can also contact the UCR campus <a style="color: blue;" href="http://www.ombudsperson.ucr.edu/">Ombudsman</a>.</p> 
       </div> 
       <h5>Who do I contact if my grade is wrong?</h5> 
       <div class="xpander"> 
        <p>If you feel a mistake has been made in assigning your grade, you must contact the faculty instructor as soon as possible. Only your faculty instructor can change your assigned grade.</p> 
       </div> 
      </div> 
      <div class="nota-bene"> 
       <h3 class="highlight">What?</h3> 
       <h5>What are the hours of operation?</h5> 
       <div class="xpander"> 
        <p>The typical hours of operation for the CNAS Undergraduate Academic Advising Center are Monday through Friday 9:00 a.m. to 12:00 p.m. and 1:00 p.m. to 4:00 p.m; we open at 10a.m. on Wednesdays.</p>

       </div> 
       <h5>What are the Registration procedures?</h5> 
       <div class="xpander"> 
        <p>Using the <a href="/majors/index.html">Major Specific</a> page you may view the registration procedures for your Major.</p> 
       </div> 
       <h5>What are the CNAS Breadth Requirements?</h5> 
       <div class="xpander"> 
        <p><a href="/files/Breadth.pdf">Breadth requirements</a> or "general education requirements" are those classes you must take outside your major to fulfill your degree requirements.&nbsp; For CNAS students these classes are typically taught by the College of Humanities, Arts and Social Sciences.&nbsp; The list provides classes that meet the breadth requirements for CNAS majors.</p> 
       </div> 
       <h5>What are my major requirements?</h5> 
       <div class="xpander"> 
        <p>Major requirements are listed in the <a style="color: blue;" href="http://catalog.ucr.edu/">UCR General Catalog</a>.&nbsp; In addition, major requirement links can be found on the <a href="/majors/index.html">Major specific page</a>. If you need assistance interpreting these requirements, please see your <a href="/advisors/academic.html">academic advisor</a>.</p> 
       </div> 
       <h5>What classes work to satisfy my ethnicity requirement?</h5> 
       <div class="xpander"> 
        <p>In order to qualify as a class that will satisfy the UCR ethnic studies degree requirement, the class must compare and contrast the experiences of various ethnic minorities of the United States.&nbsp; You can search for classes that meet this requirement in the on-line <a href="http://classes.ucr.edu/">Schedule of Classes</a> or consult with your academic advisor.</p> 
       </div> 
       <h5>What should I enroll in for my 3<sup>rd</sup> class if I'm already enrolled in 2 classes?</h5> 
       <div class="xpander"> 
        <p>Students need to enroll in sufficient classes each term to graduate in 4 years (average of 15 units/term).&nbsp; If students have questions about which classes they should enroll in, they should contact their academic advisor.</p> 
       </div> 
       <h5>What happens if I don't meet the prerequisites to an upper-division class? Can I still add it?</h5> 
       <div class="xpander"> 
        <p>If you wish to enroll in a class in which you do not meet the prerequisites, please talk to the instructor.&nbsp; Instructors may approve students to enroll in the class if they have not completed the prerequisites. Please note that prerequisites are in place for a reason and most students need the knowledge gained by successfully completing the prerequisites in order to be successful in the next class.</p> 
       </div> 
       <h5>What classes can I take during the summer? Do I need permission first?</h5> 
       <div class="xpander"> 
        <p>Students who wish to take classes at another college of university in the summer must first obtain permission from the CNAS Divisional Dean.&nbsp; Please see your academic advisor for assistance with this process and to make sure the class(es) you intend to take will count towards your degree at UCR.</p> 
       </div> 
       <h5>What classes are being offered this summer at UCR?</h5> 
       <div class="xpander"> 
        <p><a href="http://www.summer.ucr.edu">UCR Summer Session</a> classes</p> 
       </div> 
       <h5>What if I'm limited to 15 units due to Academic Action, can I still take 16 units?</h5> 
       <div class="xpander"> 
        <p>CNAS Executive Committee regulation states that students on Academic Action (Probation, Continued on Probation, Subject to Disqualification or Continued Subject to Disqualification) cannot take more than 15 units.&nbsp; We believe that students who reduce their course load will increase their academic performance which will enable students to get back into academic good standing as soon as possible and improve their grade point averages.&nbsp; Students with very good academic records can petition the Divisional Dean to take more than 15 units while on academic action.&nbsp; To ask for an exception to this regulation, students must file a blue petition at the CNAS Undergraduate Academic Advising Center.</p> 
       </div> 
       <h5>What does a "GD" (Grade Delay) mean?</h5> 
       <div class="xpander"> 
        <p>Most grade delays are assigned when your final grade was not received by the Registrar's Office in time for official grade posting.&nbsp; Occasionally grade delays may be assigned if a student has been referred to the Student Conduct and Academic Integrity Program for review.</p> 
       </div> 
       <h5>What is the Senior Residency Requirement?</h5> 
       <div class="xpander"> 
        <p>Students who graduate from UCR must earn 35 of their last 45 units in residence at UCR.&nbsp; This means at least 35 of their last 45 units must be earned by taking classes on campus at UCR.&nbsp; Students who take classes at community colleges or through UCR Extension are<em> not</em> considered "in residence."&nbsp; Special rules on residency apply to students in Education Abroad Programs.&nbsp; Please consult our office for more information regarding residency requirements.</p> 
       </div> 
       <h5>What is a Contract/Final Contract?</h5> 
       <div class="xpander"> 
        <p>If students are not in good academic standing, the major and/or the Divisional Dean may wish to contract the student for the following term.&nbsp; Typical academic contracts require students to take certain classes and earn certain grades in order to return to good standing.&nbsp; If students do not complete the terms of the academic contract in question, they may be discontinued from the major or disqualified from the university.</p> 
       </div> 
       <h5>What is discontinuation?</h5> 
       <div class="xpander"> 
        <p>Students who have not been progressing in their declared major, may be discontinued from the major.&nbsp; Discontinued students have their majors automatically changed to "Undeclared."&nbsp; Students may be discontinued for failure to complete the required major course work in a timely manner or may be discontinued for failure to achieve passing grades in major coursework.</p> 
       </div> 
       <h5>What is disqualification?</h5> 
       <div class="xpander"> 
        <p>Students who have not progressed adequately in a CNAS major may be disqualified from the university.&nbsp; Students who are disqualified are no longer regularly enrolled UCR students.&nbsp; Disqualified students may be allowed to continue taking UCR classes through UCR Extension and may be able to earn the eligibility to return to complete a degree at UCR.</p> 
       </div> 
       <h5>What should I do if I'm disqualified?</h5> 
       <div class="xpander"> 
        <p>Students who receive a disqualification notice should read it carefully and submit a Dismissal Appeal to the Divisional Dean at the CNAS UAAC by the deadline on the disqualification notice. Also, please review the <a href="/Guide%20Academic%20Recovery%20fixed%2011.4.16.pdf"><span style="color: blue;">Guide to Academic Recovery</span>.</a></p> 
       </div> 
       <h5>What if I'm on Academic Action, will I be disqualified from the University?</h5> 
       <div class="xpander"> 
        <p>Students who are on academic action are reviewed for disqualification from the university at the end of each term.&nbsp; Students who are on final contract (see Contract/Final Contract) with the CNAS Divisional Dean are particularly vulnerable to possible disqualification.&nbsp; If you are concerned about being disqualified, please see your academic advisor at the CNAS Undergraduate Academic Advising Center.</p>

       <h5>When are the Readmit Application deadlines?</h5> 
       <div class="xpander"> 
        <p>Students who have been absent from UCR for one or more quarters will need to apply for readmission to UCR through their college office.&nbsp; The college office for CNAS is located at the CNAS Undergraduate Academic Advising Center.&nbsp; The deadlines to file readmission applications are as follows:</p> 
        <ul> 
         <li>First Day of Summer Instruction for Fall quarter readmission</li> 
         <li>First Day of Fall Instruction for Winter quarter readmission</li> 
         <li>First Day of Winter Instruction for Spring quarter readmission</li> 
        </ul> 
        <p>Students who have withdrawn from the previous quarter may also need to readmit to the campus.&nbsp; Please contact our office for more information.</p> 
        <p>Sometimes students need to submit transcripts from other colleges and universities to support their eligibility to readmit to UCR.&nbsp; If a transcript is required to complete the readmission review, the readmission application should be submitted on time, even if the student has not yet completed the course(s) they are enrolled in and the transcripts are not yet available.</p>

       <h3 class="highlight">How?</h3> 
       <h5>How do I change my Major?</h5> 
       <div class="xpander"> 
        <p>Most CNAS majors have "change of major criteria"; classes that students must complete and grades they must earn in order to be eligible to declare the new major. Please view our <a href="/majors/index.html">Major specific page</a>. Once there, click on the major you're interested in to view the criteria.</p> 
        <h6>Undeclared students with more than 90 earned units:</h6> 
        <p>CNAS Executive Committee regulation states that students in CNAS must declare a major by the time they have earned 90 units. Since the most popular majors on campus require students to complete certain classes with certain grades before they can be accepted into the major, students need to meet with their intended major's Academic Advisor to design a plan that will allow change of major before the student earns 90 units.&nbsp; Students can also consult our office for more information regarding major department Change of Major procedures and policies. Students who have more than 90 earned units and have not yet declared a major, may be <a style="color: blue;" href="http://classes.ucr.edu/enrollment/problems.htm">lapsed</a> from the university.</p> 
       </div> 
       <h5>How do I know if I'm on Academic Action?</h5> 
       <div class="xpander"> 
        <p>Students can find out their academic standing by checking their grades on <a href="http://www.Rweb.ucr.edu" target="_blank">R'Web</a>.&nbsp; Underneath the quarter grades,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.Rweb.ucr.edu" target="_blank">R'Web</a> also prints the student's academic action. Sample academic actions include "Good Standing," "Academic Probation," "Continued on Academic Probation," "Subject to Disqualification," and "Continued to Subject to Disqualification." Students who have no academic action are considered in "Good Standing."</p> 
       </div> 
       <h5>How do I know if my Graduation Application was accepted and I'm ok to graduate?</h5> 
       <div class="xpander"> 
        <p>Once graduation applications have been submitted, there is no formal way to notify students that their graduation is on track but students are notified if there is a problem so "No news is good news."&nbsp; If you have questions about your eligibility to graduate, please contact your academic advisor in the CNAS Undergraduate Academic Advising Center who will refer you to your graduation advisor--a "college" academic advisor who is in charge of certifying your degree.&nbsp; Your graduation advisor will be able to tell you if your graduation is on track or not.</p>

       <h5>How many units are full-time? How many are part-time?</h5> 
       <div class="xpander"> 
        <p>Students must be enrolled in at least 12 units to be considered full time for financial aid and insurance discount purposes.&nbsp; To graduate in four years, students need to be enrolled in an average of 15 units per quarter.</p> 
        <p>Students who enroll in less than 12 units per quarter are deemed "part-time."&nbsp; Students who enroll in 10 units or less may receive a part time fee waiver by filling out the appropriate form at <a href="http://student08.ucr.edu/Em/myforms/Forms.aspx">myforms.ucr.edu</a>.&nbsp; The part time fee waiver reduces a student's educational fees (but not registration fees) by one-half.&nbsp; Students who wish to petition for a part time fee waiver should enroll in no more than 10 units and then submit a part time fee waiver.&nbsp; Part time fee waivers are accepted only until the end of the third week of the quarter.</p>

       <h5>How can I repeat a class?</h5> 
       <div class="xpander"> 
        <p>Students can repeat classes that they earned a "D+" or below in most classes (or a "C-"or below for ENGL 4, 5, or 1 classes).&nbsp; If students have already repeated a class once and have not successfully passed the class the second time, they may be eligible to repeat the class a second time (third time taking).&nbsp; Students must petition the CNAS Divisional Dean to gain permission to repeat a class a second time.&nbsp; Please see your Academic Advisor for assistance.&nbsp; Remember, if a student has not been successful in the class in multiple previous attempts, the student is not likely to be successful the third time.</p>

       <h5>How do I extend my Incomplete before it changes to an "F"? Or, how do I extend my Incomplete after it has changed to an "F" grade?</h5> 
       <div class="xpander"> 
        <p>Students can fill out an "Extension of Incomplete" petition and submit it to our office for processing. If granted, Incompletes can be extended for up to one year.</p>
