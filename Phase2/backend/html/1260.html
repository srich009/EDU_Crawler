          <blockquote> 
           <!--
Erickson:	And then you were Divisional Dean.
<P>
Helmkamp:	Yes.  Physical Sciences.
<P>
Erickson:	How did that come about?
<P>
Helmkamp:	The chair is a rotating position.
<P>
Erickson:	Every two �
<P>
Helmkamp:	In the early days, it was about five years, and so my turn just came around.  And who makes the choice is an open question.  I don't know.
<P>
Erickson:	How about the deanship?
<P>
Helmkamp:	That came out of the blue.  Dean Golino contacted me one time and asked if I would like to be Associate Dean for Physical Sciences.
<P>
Erickson:	You weren't chair at that point.  You were a professor.
<P>
Helmkamp:	That is correct.  I was simply a professor.
<P>
Erickson:	You didn't even know he was considering you?
<P>
Helmkamp:	No.
<P>
Erickson:	Were you hesitant or did you want to accept it right away?
<P>
Helmkamp:	No, I was happy to accept that.
<P>
Erickson:	And what did that mean you would be doing then?
<P>
Helmkamp:	We would make recommendations about promotions and budgetary allocations within our area and also comment on other areas.  We always met as a group, all of the associate deans and Golino.
<P>
Erickson:	How long did you do that?
<P>
Helmkamp:	One year.  They needed a Chairman of the Budget Committee,  and       (chuckle)       I was chosen Chairman of the Budget Committee for the following year.
<P>
Erickson:	And the Budget Committee is now called the Committee on Academic Personnel, is that correct?
<P>
Helmkamp:	Well, right now there are apparently two committees: one on budget and one on personnel.
<P>
Erickson:	Oh, ok.
<P>
Helmkamp:	That happened after I left.
<P>
Erickson:	Yours would have included both.
<P>
Helmkamp:	Included both, um hmm, but we were given very little opportunity to deal with budgetary matters.
<P>
Erickson:	Did you accept that?
<P>
Helmkamp:	Yes.
<P>
Erickson:	Oh, my.  That must have been a huge responsibility.
<P>
Helmkamp:	That was terrible.
<P>
(laughter)
<P>
Erickson:	When you do something like that, do you still maintain all the classes you are teaching and the research work that you are doing?
<P>
Helmkamp:	Yes, I did.  And also when I was chairman I did.  I was chairman at a time when the course load was one major course, so that wasn't a great problem.
<P>
Erickson:	And how long did you do that, I am sorry.  You said it earlier.
<P>
Helmkamp:	I am not sure but I would guess seven years.
<P>
Erickson:	Oh, a long time.  My goodness.
--> Erickson: We have in front of us this beautiful mace that you made. Would you tell us how that came to be? 
           <p> Helmkamp: I should hold it up, I guess. </p>
           <p> Erickson: Yes, so the camera can get a good picture. </p>
           <p> Helmkamp: They were having processions at graduation and somebody just mentioned that most processions are associated with a mace. Whoever is leading the procession is carrying some device, and we just had a discussion. I think it was in the associate deans meeting when someone proposed � "shouldn't we have a mace and how do we get one made?" </p>
           <p> Erickson: Um hmm. </p>
           <p> Helmkamp: There was the one idiot who volunteered (to try to make the mace). </p>
           <p> (laughter) </p>
           <p> Since I did wood work, I decided I would try to make the mace. </p>
           <p> Erickson: So did that mean that you designed it also? </p>
           <p> Helmkamp: Designed it, yes. We decided as a group about some features that should be involved. We decided on the California bear. And the Great Seal, whichever is the Great Seal. This is the University of California seal, I guess, and in the back it's the Great Seal of California. </p>
           <p> Erickson: Oh, I see. I didn't see that one before. </p>
           <p> Helmkamp: It turned out that the chancellor's office had this Great Seal and the Seal of California, and so all we had to do was find somebody to do the bear. </p>
           <p> The last thing we wanted to do � we wanted to have something representative of the Citrus Experiment Station. We wanted to have a gold orange, � </p>
           <p> Erickson: Yes. </p>
           <p> Helmkamp: and the people who made the bear could not make the orange. It kept collapsing. So we just put a semi-orange piece on the bottom. That's as close as they could come in wood � </p>
           <p> Erickson: Sure. </p>
           <p> Helmkamp: to represent that. </p>
           <p> Erickson: Did somebody make a mold of the bear? Is that what you mean? </p>
           <p> Helmkamp: Yes, um hmm. </p>
           <p> Erickson: Well, tell us about the wood in there that you used. </p>
           <p> Helmkamp: Most of the wood is koa from Hawaii, which I happened to have in my shop. The dark wood is desert ironwood, which comes from our local deserts. </p>
           <p> Erickson: It's very pretty. </p>
           <p> Helmkamp: So all the dark wood is desert ironwood. </p>
           <p> Erickson: And the orange is also the ironwood? </p>
           <p> Helmkamp: No, the orange � I don't even know what it is any more. </p>
           <p> Erickson: It's so pretty. (pause) When did you become interested in working with wood? </p>
           <p> Helmkamp: Oh, when I was about eight. </p>
           <p> Erickson: Oh, no kidding. Was your father good, too � good with wood? </p>
           <p> Helmkamp: He didn't do anything like that.<br> </p>
