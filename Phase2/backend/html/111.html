        <h4 class="section2">School of Medicine Mission</h4> 
        <div class="xpander"> 
         <p>The mission of the UCR School of Medicine is to improve the health of the people of California and, especially, to serve Inland Southern California by training a diverse workforce of physicians and by developing innovative research and health care delivery programs that will improve the health of the medically underserved in the region and become models to be emulated throughout the state and nation.</p> 
         <p>In recognition of this charge, the UCR medical school has the following goals for its faculty:</p> 
         <ul class="tight"> 
          <li>Provide students in the program with extensive personal advising by medical school faculty to assist them in evaluating their career aspirations,</li> 
          <li>Deliver basic science and clinical instruction in a small group learning environment with intensive instructor-student interaction,</li>

          <li>An enthusiasm for life-long, discerning, self-education;</li> 
          <li>A commitment to humanistic, compassionate, and ethical care of the individual and family;</li> 
          <li>An ongoing development of a broad foundation of knowledge and skills that integrates basic, clinical, social and behavioral sciences with the art of medicine;</li> 
          <li>An understanding of the scientific method, an appreciation of its role in basic and clinical research, and the development and application of these habits of inquiry to address real problems;</li> 
          <li>An active concern for the promotion of the health and well-being of the community with sensitivity to its diversity, and an understanding of the special challenges and requirements of a pluralistic society;</li> 
          <li>Skills in effective communication, including the teaching of students, colleagues, patients and the community; and</li> 
          <li>The ability to provide flexible, creative leadership in the setting of rapidly changing technology and societal needs through a systematic, multidisciplinary, and collaborative approach.</li>

        <h4 class="section2">Diversity</h4> 
        <div class="xpander"> 
         <p>The following statement on diversity has been adopted by the medical school faculty.</p> 
         <p>We, the faculty, students and staff of the UCR School of Medicine believe that a diverse student body, faculty and staff are essential to achievement of academic excellence. We are committed to recruiting students, faculty and staff responsive to our mission whose diversity contributes to an optimal learning environment. People of varied backgrounds, by which we mean those with a variety of personal experiences, values and worldviews arising from differences of culture and circumstance, bring added value to the education of students, research, and service to the community. In building a diverse medical school, those differences that can add to the value of our educational environment include, but are not limited to: gender, race, ethnicity, age, religious affiliation, abilities/disabilities, educational or socio-economic disadvantage (distance traveled), first in family to attend an institution of higher learning, personal or family experience of having limited access to health care, unique or challenging life experiences, and sexual orientation.</p> 
         <p>We are committed to recognizing and nurturing merit, talent and achievement by supporting diversity and equal opportunity in our education, services and administration, as well as research and creative activity. We will endeavor to remove barriers to the recruitment, retention, and advancement of talented students, faculty and staff from historically excluded populations who are currently underrepresented in medical education and the practice of medicine. Recruitment efforts and resources will be aligned with the goal to recruit individuals from groups underrepresented in medicine into faculty positions, recognizing that faculty, in particular, serve as role models to attract a diverse student body. Given the mission of the UCR School of Medicine and the desire to see the faculty, as well as the student body, reflect the cultural, socioeconomic, and ethnic diversity of the region that we serve, searches will endeavor to recruit faculty with these diverse characteristics.</p> 
        </div>

        <div class="xpander"> 
         <p>The UCR School of Medicine admissions committee seeks students with diverse intellectual and life experiences. The admissions process will use a holistic review of applicants, meaning that each applicant's non-academic credentials will be considered as carefully as his or her academic record. The committee will also consider the "distance traveled" by each applicant to arrive at this stage of his or her career, recognizing that not all applicants have equal access to resources, mentorship, and strong high school preparation before arriving at college. The committee will review each applicant's complete portfolio carefully in order to select students who are not only academically qualified but who have the breadth of volunteer/community and personal experiences to ensure that they will become physicians well prepared to care for the diverse population in our communities.</p> 
         <h5>Key Attributes</h5> 
         <p>A subset of qualified applicants will be invited to visit the UCR School of Medicine and to take part in a series of interviews. Selection will be based on:</p> 
         <ul class="tight"> 
          <li>The academic competitiveness of the applicants, specifically their performance in upper level courses, both in science and non-science disciplines,</li> 
          <li>The strength of their letters of recommendation, specifically regarding character traits such as leadership, integrity, commitment to hard work, and communication skills (see personal core attributes described below),</li> 
          <li>The applicants' achievements and honors received,</li> 
          <li>The quality and duration of their extracurricular activities in areas such as research, teaching, work experience, and special talents,</li> 
          <li>The demonstrated commitment to community service, particularly to underserved populations, and</li>

         </ul> 
         <p>The admissions committee also values the core personal attributes for entering medical school endorsed on November 29, 2011 by the Group on Student Affairs Committee on Admissions of the Association of American Medical Colleges. This core set of attributes includes the following characteristics:</p> 
         <ul class="tight"> 
          <li>Integrity and Ethics</li> 
          <li>Reliability and Dependability</li>

         </ul> 
         <h5>Application Procedure</h5> 
         <p>Applicants to the UCR School of Medicine must submit an application through the <a class="external" onclick="ga('send','event','med_school_admissions','goto_amcas_application_info_lower')" href="https://www.aamc.org/students/applying/amcas/" target="_blank">American Medical College Application Service (AMCAS)</a> no later than Nov. 1, 2017. A complete set of official transcripts must be forwarded to AMCAS by the registrar of all the higher education institutions attended.</p> 
         <p>Three to five individual letters of recommendation are required. These letters may be written by a premedical advisor, undergraduate faculty, mentors or any individual of your choice. UCR will participate in the AMCAS Letters Service for the 2015-16 application year. <a class="external" onclick="ga('send','event','med_school_admissions','goto_amcas_letters_advisors')" href="https://www.aamc.org/students/advisors/amcas-advisors/370390/amcas-letters-advisors.html" target="_blank">Please visit their website for more details about this service</a>. Letters must be original, signed documents on institutional letterhead, and be submitted by Nov. 15, 2017.</p> 
         <p>Applicants will be notified by e-mail if approved for a secondary application. If approved, you will be able to access the secondary applications through the link on the status-check page on AMCAS. All communication will be through e-mail. To that end, please add the UCR School of Medicine domain (ucr.edu) to your "safe" list (particularly Hotmail and Yahoo users) and make sure to regularly check your junk mail as the second application is time-sensitive.</p> 
         <p>Students are offered an interview based on their AMCAS application and their secondary application. Candidates selected for interviews will be notified by e-mail. At this stage, only those candidates who have been interviewed can be considered for admission. Interviews will be scheduled on selected weekends from September through March and will be conducted in the Multiple Mini-Interview (MMI) format. Information about the MMI process can be found in the article <a class="external" onclick="ga('send','event','med_school_admissions','goto_tufts_article')" href="http://uss.tufts.edu/hpa/PDF/MMI.pdf" target="_blank">Eva et al., "An Admissions OSCE: the Multiple Mini-Interview", Medical Education 38: 314-326, 2004</a>.</p> 
         <p>Decisions for admissions are made on a rolling basis. Acceptances will continue until the class is full. Admission is provisional until cleared by the criminal background check process. Admission decisions are final and thus are not subject to appeal. A student not admitted as a result of the first application may file a second application the following year, however a third application cycle is strongly discouraged. An applicant may request a deferral for up to one year by writing to the Admissions Office. The decision to grant the deferral is made on an individual basis.</p>

        <div class="xpander"> 
         <h5 class="SupportingDocumentationBulletedList"><strong>University of California, Riverside School of Medicine Technical, Non-Academic, Standards</strong></h5> 
         <h6 class="SupportingDocumentationBulletedList">Essential Abilities and Characteristics Required for Completion of the M.D. Degree</h6> 
         <h6 class="SupportingDocumentationBulletedList"><strong>Introduction</strong></h6> 
         <p class="SupportingDocumentationBulletedList">The M.D. degree is a broad undifferentiated degree attesting to general knowledge in medicine and the basic skills required for the practice of medicine. Essential abilities and characteristics required for completion of the M.D. degree consist of certain minimum physical and cognitive abilities and sufficient mental and emotional stability to assure that candidates for admission, promotion, and graduation are able to complete the entire course of study and participate fully in all aspects of medical training. The School of Medicine intends for its graduates to become competent and compassionate physicians who are capable of pursuing and completing graduate medical education, passing licensing exams and obtaining and maintaining medical licensure. The avowed intention of an individual student to practice only a narrow part of clinical medicine, or to pursue a non-clinical career, does not alter the requirement that all medical students take and achieve competence in the full curriculum required by the faculty. For purposes of this document and unless otherwise defined, the term "candidate" means candidates for admission to medical school as well as enrolled medical students who are candidates for promotion and graduation.</p> 
         <p class="SupportingDocumentationBulletedList">The School of Medicine has an ethical responsibility for the safety of patients with whom students and graduates will come in contact. Although students learn and work under the supervision of the faculty, students interact with patients throughout their medical school education. Patient safety and well-being are therefore major factors in establishing requirements involving the physical, cognitive, and emotional abilities of candidates for admission, promotion, and graduation. The essential abilities and characteristics described herein are also referred to as technical (or non-academic) standards. They are described below in several broad categories including: observation; communication; motor function; intellectual-conceptual, integrative, and quantitative abilities; and social and behavioral skills. In addition to these, candidates must have the physical stamina and emotional stability to function in a competent manner in settings that may involve heavy workloads and stressful situations. Individuals who constitute a direct threat to the health and safety of others or are currently impaired by alcohol or other substance abuse are not suitable candidates for admission, promotion or graduation.</p> 
         <p class="SupportingDocumentationBulletedList">Delineation of technical standards is required for the accreditation of U.S. medical schools by the Liaison Committee on Medical Education (LCME). The following abilities and characteristics are defined as technical standards, which in conjunction with academic standards established by the faculty, are requirements for admission, promotion, and graduation.

         <h6 class="SupportingDocumentationBulletedList"><strong>Equal Access to the School of Medicine's Educational Program</strong></h6> 
         <p class="SupportingDocumentationBulletedList">The University of California does not discriminate against qualified individuals with disabilities who apply for admission to the M.D. degree program or who are enrolled as medical students. Otherwise qualified individuals shall not be excluded from admission or participation in the School of Medicine's educational programs and activities solely by reason of their disability or medical condition.

         <p class="SupportingDocumentationBulletedList">Students with a disability must meet these technical standards, with or without accommodation.&nbsp; It is the responsibility of an admitted or continuing student with a disability, or a student who develops a disability, and who needs an accommodation to notify the Office of Student Special Services of the disability and provide adequate documentation of the general nature and extent of the disability and the functional limitations to be accommodated. A student who has or develops any chronic disease or condition will be expected to seek and continue in the care of a qualified health care provider, if the disease or condition could place patients or others at risk.&nbsp; Evaluating and facilitating accommodation requests is a collaborative effort between the admitted or continuing student, the Office of Student Special Services and the Senior Associate Dean for SOM Student Affairs. The UCR SOM reserves the right to request new or additional information.</p> 
         <p>Should an admitted or continuing student have or develop a condition that would place patients, the student, or others at risk or that may affect his/her need for accommodation, an evaluation with the Office of Student Special Services may be necessary. As in initial assessments, a complete and careful reconsideration of all the skills, attitudes, and attributes of each candidate will be performed. This includes an assessment of his/her willingness, desire and ability to complete the medical curriculum and fulfill all requirements for medical licensure, and will be informed by the knowledge that students with varied types of disabilities have the ability to become successful medical professionals.</p>

        <h4 class="section2">Information for Undocumented Applicants to UC Riverside</h4> 
        <div class="xpander"> 
         <p>Undocumented students of all ethnicities and nationalities can find a safe and supportive community at the University of California. UC campuses offer a range of support services and various programs to help undocumented students transition to and succeed at UC. There are also a number of opportunities available after graduating from college, including applying to graduate school. The University of California offers more than 600 graduate degree programs across 10 campuses, which includes educational programs at six UC medical schools.</p> 
         <p>UC is committed to fostering diversity by recruiting qualified and diverse candidates seeking a medical education, including students with Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) immigration status, those who are DACA-eligible, or those who are otherwise undocumented. Applications from undocumented applicants are considered under the same admissions standards as for any other applicant.</p> 
         <h5>Important Facts for Prospective Applicants to UC Medical Schools</h5> 
         <p>Undocumented students, who would like to apply to a UC medical school, should note some important facts:</p> 
         <ul class="tight"> 
          <li>There are no restrictions to prevent undocumented students from attending public graduate or professional schools in California.</li> 
          <li>Applicants are not required to have a Social Security Number to apply.</li> 
          <li>Those who qualify for the Association of American Medical College (AAMC) Fee Assistance Program (FAP) may be eligible for fee waivers for supplemental applications.</li> 
          <li>Under a federal law called FERPA&nbsp;(Family Education Rights and Privacy Act), universities cannot release a student’s information to a third party without their permission, including the fact that they are undocumented, except under very limited specific circumstances, such as a court order.</li> 
          <li>Applicants offered admission may be eligible to apply for some forms of <a href="http://ph.ucla.edu/current-students/fsph-financial-opportunities">financial aid and scholarships</a> (see details below). UC medical schools will work actively to explore mechanisms for financial aid for all students. However, there is no guarantee that sufficient funding from the University of California will be available to meet the financial needs of a student with limited options for aid.</li> 
          <li>Applicants who enroll in a UC medical education program may have limitations on some curricular experiences (e.g., participating in clinical rotations at certain training sites) as a result of their citizenship status.</li> 
          <li>Beginning in 2016, the Medical Board of California, which is the state entity that licenses physicians in California, will consider applicants regardless of immigration status, however, an applicant must have an individual taxpayer identification number or a social security number to obtain licensure. See <a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?lawCode=BPC&amp;sectionNum=30">Sections 30</a> and <a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?lawCode=BPC&amp;sectionNum=135.5">135.5</a> of the Business and Professions Code.</li> 
          <li>Entering students should be advised that there is no guarantee of admission to a graduate medical education program in the state of California. The status of licensure in other states is uncertain at this time. Students will need to seek information about applicable rules and regulations in states in which they are considering applying for residency training, licensure or future practice.</li> 
          <li>Under DACA,&nbsp;students receive work authorization and a temporary Social Security Number from the federal government.</li> 
          <li>DACA is an executive order and not law. It will remain in effect unless rescinded.</li> 
         </ul> 
         <h5>Applying to Medical School at the University of California</h5> 
         <ul class="tight"> 
          <li>Individuals with DACA status applying to a UC medical school can refer to “Section Three: Biographical Information” of the American Medical College Application Service (<a href="https://www.aamc.org/students/download/182162/data/amcas_instruction_manual.pdf">AMCAS) Instructions Manual</a> for guidance on disclosing information about their immigration status on their AMCAS application.&nbsp;</li> 
         </ul> 
         <h5>Financial Aid Opportunities</h5> 
         <ul class="tight"> 
          <li>All students, regardless of immigration status, are required to pay tuition and other mandatory fees.&nbsp; All students have the responsibility to obtain funding for tuition, other required fees and associated costs of attendance (e.g., housing, books, etc.).</li> 
          <li>Undocumented graduate students at UC are not eligible for funding from federal sources. However, depending on their AB540 status, they may be eligible to receive aid from state, institutional and/or private sources.</li> 
          <li>Undocumented students who do not have AB 540 status cannot receive institutional fellowships from either the University of California or from private donor funds administered through the University of California. Private loans and private scholarships or fellowships through a non-university based entity, or external entity are the only financial aid options for students who do not have AB 540 status.</li> 
          <li>Individuals with DACA and AB 540 status qualify for in-state tuition. These students also qualify for financial assistance under AB131 and AB130, which allow students to apply for and receive scholarships derived from non-state funds and California state aid.</li> 
          <li>Some UC medical schools offer merit-based scholarships to individuals who matriculate at one of our campuses. All applicants, including DACA students with AB 540 status, are considered for these scholarships through the application and interview process.</li>
