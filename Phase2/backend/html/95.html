       <h2>Information Collection and Use</h2>REGISTRATION
       <br>The Localist Service requires a login in order to provide You with a personalized account. During our account registration process, we will collect a login name, password, and an email address from you, and we may collect other information from You that will be shown in the form you submit. You must provide all of this information in order to obtain an account. After completing our registration form, You will receive a welcome email describing Your new Localist account, and how to access that account. You may, at Your option, also store Your social media credentials as part of Your account with our Service.
       <br>
       <br>We may also allow You to login using a social media account with a third party (e.g. Facebook® or Twitter® or a similar account). When You do this, the third party shares with us certain information through their Application Program Interface (API). We do not control what information such third party may provide us, and we do not control whether such information is encrypted. We may store the information provided by such third party on our own site, to facilitate the login process, and to link our site to the third party site in accordance with their API. We will conform our actions to any limitations or requirements of such third party in use of their API. We recommend that You review the privacy and information / data collection and use policies of the third party API provider.
       <br>
       <br>ACCOUNT SUBSCRIPTIONS
       <br>If You choose to continue service with Localist via a paid account, Localist will collect personally identifiable information (credit card number, billing address, phone number and other relevant account information) and send this information to our billing system's secure server in order to process Your recurring invoices. This information is only used to verify credit card authenticity, make charges that You have authorized, and issue invoices as per Your service agreement. Upon discontinuation of Localist service, subject to the other provisions below (for example, any legal obligation we have to keep such information) Your information will be deleted in our billing system (however, some data may remain in our backup system until it has been purged through regular backup rotation).
       <br>
       <br>If we are unable to process Your subscription for a given month, this information, along with Your account information, may be used to contact you.
       <br>
       <br>TELL-A-FRIEND TOOLS
       <br>Localist provides a number of tools that will allow You to promote Your calendar (or Content on Your calendar) over email and other electronic communication means. Email addresses and user IDs on other systems that allow such communication that is entered into these forms are not stored in our database, but may be stored in our system logs in text format to assist us in tracking down abusive users (users flooding the system), or users using these tools for spamming or other violations of our Terms of Service or Applicable Law (as defined in the Terms of Service). We will never contact addresses logged in this manner (however, the communication that emanates from use of this service may contain link backs to our site and may contain other content we place on or in such communications). The email sent through any of these mechanisms is a one time email only.
       <br>
       <br>HOSTED CALENDARS
       <br>Users hosting calendars with Localist are given tools that may ask You to optionally enter Your email address when making comments on their platform, or contacting them through their platform. Users on Localist may manipulate the HTML code on their site directly, there are opportunities available for a malicious user to inject code that would log Your information before it reaches our system. In addition, once in our system, platform users will have the opportunity to review and modify any information entered into their platform. Localist does not have full control over how members run their individual calendars, nor do we monitor or test that usage for compliance with our policies. This Privacy Policy does not apply to any hosted Localist calendar that You do not control. Therefore You should check that You trust the controller of a particular platform before submitting personally identifiable information on that site.
       <br>
       <br>SERVER LOGS
       <br>When accessing web pages on the Localist.com domain, Localist may log Your IP address, access URL, time of access, browser type, referral URL and other "meta data" that an internet packet typically contains, in order to provide us with internal information regarding site traffic statistics ("Site Usage Data"). This information may also be used by Localist to identify users who are using the service for spam or other activity that is deemed in conflict with our Terms of Service or Applicable Law.
       <br>
       <br>We may de-identify and then aggregate Site Usage Data - and if we do this, such aggregated, de-identified data is never linked back to any of Your personally identifiable information. However, as we maintain Site Usage Data for our own internal purposes, if we receive a legal request for such data and we comply with such request, Your identified information contained in Site Usage Data might be required to be disclosed.
       <br>
       <br>SECTION 2
       <p></p>
       <h2>Uses of Information</h2>Localist collects the aforementioned personally identifiable information in order to provide You with a service that allows You to maintain an online presence. Various features in our calendar management system will, at Your discretion, display Your name, or adjust the date and time of events based on Your locale or other information. The Localist Administration interface will give You an option with respect to some of Your personally identifiable information before it is presented on Your website. We may add or change the types of information that is within the control of each user through the Localist Administration.
       <br>
       <br>Localist uses information collected through its Service to send out notifications regarding service related issues (such as maintenance periods, billing problems, account expirations, and other items that may impact service). We do not send contact information unless the matter is deemed urgent, and most communication will occur through Your Localist Administration interface. We also may use Your information to send You messages regarding new Service or other products from Localist, but will not share this information with third parties for any marketing purposes.
       <br>
       <br>Information collected through our service logs is used only to identify potential cases of abuse, non compliance with our Terms of Service, and Applicable law, and establish statistical information regarding website traffic. This statistical information is not aggregated in such a way that would identify any particular user of the system.
       <br>
       <br>Localist, Corp. is the sole owner of information collected on http://www.localist.com/.
       <br>
       <br>SECTION 3

       <h2>Access to Personally Identifiable Information</h2>CHANGING INFORMATION
       <br>All information that Localist stores related to Your account, including any subscription billing information, is accessible through Your Localist Administration interface. You may use this interface to adjust Your information at any time, and we encourage You to keep this information up to date so that Your customer service requests and billing processes operate efficiently.
       <br>
       <br>REMOVING INFORMATION
       <br>To remove Your personally identifiable information from our system, submit Your account for deactivation. Your personal information will be promptly marked for data purge, though Your actual login name will remain reserved on our system until re-collection. If You wish to only remove Your billing subscription information, cancel Your paid account. Both of these removals can be accessed through Your Localist Administration interface. After account de-activation, we may delete Your personal data (or we may elect to retain it, in a form that is not accessible except to us, for period of time in case You might re-activate or in the case of a dispute), however (a) we may maintain transactional data (e.g. order history, service acceptance communications, and other data we deem necessary if any dispute about our service might arise); and (b) we will not initiate a purge from backup locations or tapes - and Your data may reside on those locations until the tape or location is overwritten or marked for deletion and then deleted.

       <h2>Communications from Localist, Corp.</h2>SERVICE-RELATED ANNOUNCEMENTS

For instance, if our service is temporarily suspended for maintenance, we might send You an email. Generally, You may not opt-out of these communications, which are not promotional in nature. If You do not wish to receive them, You have the option to deactivate Your account.
       <br>

       <h2>Information Sharing and Disclosure</h2>AGGREGATE INFORMATION (NON-PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE)
       <br>We may share de-identified aggregated demographic information about our user base with our advertisers. This information does not identify individual users. This information contains statistics related to traffic and the geographic location of our customers. We also may share de-identified aggregated user information with third parties who help us to analyze our user base to improve the Service.
       <br>
       <br>We do not maintain a database that directly links aggregate user data with personally identifiable information. However, if we are required to provide logs and data pursuant to a legal demand such as under subpoena, a person may be able to link aggregated user data and personally identifiable information by other techniques.
       <br>
       <br>PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION
       <br>Localist employs third-party service providers to perform functions on our behalf. Examples include credit card processing, email service providers, data metrics and analysis companies and customer service outsource companies. These service providers have access to personal information needed to perform their functions, but our agreements with them provide that they would be in breach of such agreements if they use such data for any other purpose. We expect such companies to uphold their contracts, however, You agree that we are not liable to You if a service provider of ours breaches our agreement and misuses Your data (You will have a claim directly against them, and we will cooperate reasonably in such claim).
       <br>
       <br>We may release account and other personal information when we believe release is appropriate to comply with the law; enforce or apply our Terms of Service; or protect the rights, property, or safety of Localist, our users, or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection and credit risk reduction.

       <br>Localist may use social media and electronic marketing to display dynamically or statically generated content on the site, and the content displayed may be tailored for You based on Your use of the site and information We have about You; provided that, except to the extent that you have connected to our site using Social Media Tools (defined below), and then only as described below, we do not transmit Your personally identifiable information to such third parties, rather, we take information we have about the third party content provider and we take information we have about You and we determine which content to present to You.
       <br>
       <br>"Social Media Tools" refers to the software, scripts and functionality that some services (e.g. Facebook® or Twitter® or a similar site) provide to users to integrate their social media interactions across platforms and sites. We may provide You with the ability to make use of Social Media Tools on our site. If we do this, we will comply with the rules and regulations of the service provider; however, we do not review or otherwise vouch for such Social Media Tools, nor do we control what those other sites do with the data that is generated by use of such Social Media Tools (in some cases we may not even know what data they have access to, as they can run such Social Media Tools in scripts and programs that we cannot see or monitor). By using Social Media Tools, you are agreeing that your personal data, which may include personally identifiable data, and which may also include Site Usage Data, can be shared with the provider of the applicable Social Media Tools that you are using, but this agreement is only to the extent of the actual functionality of the particular Social Media Tool You have enabled.

       <h2>Privacy Shield Participation: Data Transfers from the EU to the United States</h2>Localist participates in and complies with the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of Personal Data transferred from the European Union to the United States. Localist has certified to the Department of Commerce that it adheres to the Privacy Shield Principles.
       <br>If there is any conflict between the terms in this privacy policy and the Privacy Shield Principles, the Privacy Shield Principles shall govern. To learn more about the Privacy Shield program, and to view Localist’s certification, please visit https://www.privacyshield.gov/ (or find the direct link to the certification list of Privacy Shield participants maintained by the Department of Commerce https://www.privacyshield.gov/list).
       <br>What does this mean for the European User?
       <br>Localist is responsible for all processing of Personal Data it receives under the Privacy Shield Framework from European Union individuals and commits to subject the processed Personal Data to the Privacy Shield Principles.
       <br>This, most importantly, includes the right of individuals to access their personal data processed by Localist.
       <br>Localist also complies with the Privacy Shield Principles for all onward transfers of Personal Data from the EU, which means that it remains liable in cases of onward transfers to third parties.
       <br>With respect to Personal Data received or transferred pursuant to the Privacy Shield Framework, Localist is subject to the investigatory and regulatory enforcement powers of the FTC, if not stated otherwise in this privacy policy.
       <br>Localist is further required to disclose Personal Data in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements.

European Union individuals with inquiries or complaints regarding this Privacy Shield policy should first contact Localist at the contact details supplied at the beginning of this document referring to “Privacy Shield” and expect the complaint to be dealt with within 45 days.
       <br>In case of failure by Localist to provide a satisfactory or timely response, the User has the option of involving an independent dispute resolution body, free of charge.
       <br>In this regard, Localist has agreed to cooperate with the panel established by the EU data protection authorities (DPAs) and comply with the advice given by the panel with regard to data transferred from the EU. The User may therefore contact Localist at the email address provided at the beginning of this document in order to be directed to the relevant DPA contacts.
       <br>Under certain conditions – available for the User in full on the Privacy Shield website (https://www.privacyshield.gov/article?id=How-to-Submit-a-Complaint) – the User may invoke binding arbitration when other dispute resolution procedures have been exhausted
