      <p>RIVERSIDE, Calif. (<a href="http://www.ucr.edu">www.ucr.edu</a>) â Californiaâs longest-running free literary event, <a href="http://writersweek.ucr.edu/">Writers Week</a>, will return to the University of California, Riverside for its 41st installment Feb. 12-17, 2018.</p> 
      <p>Feminist icon and National Medal of Arts recipient Maxine Hong Kingston, best-selling novelist Janet Fitch, and Haitian-American essayist and New York Times columnist Roxane Gay will headline the event, joining an additional 17 authors for an on-campus series of presentations and readings.</p> 
      <p>In keeping with the eventâs emphasis on showcasing diverse voices, this yearâs lineup of featured writers reflects a range of perspectives from around the country and world, said Tom Lutz, a professor of creative writing at UCR and the eventâs director.</p>
