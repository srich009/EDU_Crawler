     <!--FAQ----------------------------------> 
     <div id="faq"> 
      <div class="texttab-column"> 
       <ul class="standout"> 
        <li>Why have fees increased? 
         <div class="xpander">
          Rising costs to run and sustain the program have resulted in our inability to continue the program unless fees were raised to an adequate amount. Staffing is the biggest cost of the program, and materials make up the second biggest cost.&nbsp; Although the program receives administrative assistance from other ARC staff members, the fees currently aim to support one full-time staff member and four to five part-time staff members, all of whom are in the classroom helping students improve their scores.
         </div> </li> 
        <li>How do the classes compare to other test prep companies? 
         <div class="xpander">
          Preparing for a standardized test like the GMAT, GRE, LSAT, or MCAT requires significant self-study. It requires a substantial time commitment regardless of which company you choose. The key to doing well on any standardized test is to take as many practice tests as possible. We recommend at least 5 (including a pre-test). After each practice test, check your mistakes and study to strengthen that weakness. This may mean memorizing more vocabulary (crucial for doing well on the GRE verbal section), doing more practice math problems, or having someone edit your writing. All of this requires one thing: time. Some companies offer a money-back guarantee, but if you read the disclaimers, you must complete all of the assigned homework, attend all of the classes, and take all of the practice tests. It is unlikely that a student will not score higher after completing these requirements. Our instructors will help you focus your studies to strengthen any weaknesses determined by your pre-test score. The instructors also have regular office hours, so you can receive some personalized help from these college-level instructors.
         </div> </li> 
        <li>Do students score higher after taking an ARC Exam Prep Seminar? 
         <div class="xpander">
          Mostly 'yes' and sometimes 'no', depending on how much time and effort students put into practicing and reviewing. We recommend at least one summer if you do not have a full-time job or other priorities. If you are a full-time student, we recommend one year of preparation. If you put a substantial amount of effort into studying for the exam and did not score as high as you would have liked, please come in to speak with one of our staff members. Statistically, students who study and do not score high are unlikely to increase their scores significantly. We would, however, still like to see if we can help you improve your score.
         </div> </li> 
        <li>What materials are included and what content is covered in the ARC Exam Prep Seminars? 
         <div class="xpander">
          For the GMAT and GRE prep seminars, students will receive a test-prep book from a well-known test-prep company or the test creators. No additional fee is required for the book, but we will also not be able to discount the price of the seminar if you already own a copy of the text used in the seminar you attend. Depending on the seminar, you will review math (GRE, GMAT), reading (GMAT, GRE, LSAT, &amp; MCAT), writing (GMAT &amp; GRE), critical thinking and reasoning (GMAT, LSAT, &amp; MCAT), life and physical sciences (MCAT), and behavioral and social sciences (MCAT). We will also focus on test-taking strategies and study skills.
         </div> </li> 
        <li>How much time do I need to study for a graduate or professional school exam? 
         <div class="xpander">
          We recommend a year of preparation for full-time students. Finishing coursework and filling out applications to graduate or professional school are very time consuming. If you are working (part-time or full-time) or have family, a year will work as well, but we recommend giving yourself as much time as possible. You can also study over one summer if you are not taking classes and if you are not working more than part-time (20 hours/week).
         </div> </li> 
        <li>Do I have to be a registered, full-time student at UCR to take the seminars? 
         <div class="xpander">
          No, but priority is given to currently registered, full-time UCR students. Full-time students are registered for at least 12 units in the current or in the following regular academic quarter. If you want to enroll in a summer seminar, you must be registered as a full-time student for the following fall quarter at UCR to be given priority.
         </div> </li> 
        <li>Is there a waiting list? 
         <div class="xpander">
          Yes, there is a waiting list. If you are unable to register online, the seminar is full. Please send an e-mail to the contact e-mail address and type “waiting list” and the name of the exam for which you are preparing in the subject line. In the body of the e-mail, give us your full name, student ID number, and contact telephone number. If you do not have a UCR student ID number, please let us know whether you are 1) an UCR alumnus, 2) an UCR staff member, or 3) not affiliated with UCR.
         </div> </li> 
        <li>Why don’t I see a charge on my UCR student billing account after I register?<span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><br></strong></span> 
         <div class="xpander">
          Students are not billed at the time they register. For the regular academic year, expect to see a charge to your student billing account on the first or second week of the quarter. For the summer, expect to see a charge to your student billing account in the first week of Summer Session I. If you are an UCR alumnus (already graduated), please call the UCR Office of the Registrar Help Desk at (951) 827-7284 and ask if your student billing account is still active.
         </div> </li> 
        <li>How do I pay if I do NOT have an active student billing account because I am not a registered UCR student or I already graduated from UCR? 
         <div class="xpander">
          If you are not a registered UCR student, payment must be received within three days of registering online. We must receive payment for the total cost of the seminar in the form of a check or money order (absolutely no cash accepted) made payable to 
          <em>Regents UC</em>. You can send your check or money order to Academic Resource Center, Exam Prep Seminars, University of California, Riverside, 900 University Avenue, Surge Building, 1st Floor, Riverside, CA 92521 or bring a check or money order to the front desk of the Academic Resource Center during our hours of operation (Mon-Thurs, 9am-7pm; Fri, 9am-5pm). We are located on the first floor of the 
          <a href="http://campusmap.ucr.edu/imap/index.html?loc=SURGE">Surge Building</a> (click for location on the campus map). The nearest campus parking lot is Lot 24, where permits can be purchased after 4pm. Please check the 
          <a href="http://campusmap.ucr.edu/imap/index.html">UCR campus map</a>.
         </div> </li> 
        <li>What should I do if I am unable to attend the scheduled pre-test? 
         <div class="xpander">
          You do not need to take the pre-test with us. As long as you have a pre-test score (it could be the score from an actual test you recently took), we can use it to gauge your improvement. For the LSAT (paper test) and MCAT (online), we have set pre-test dates for students to come to the ARC to take the test, but students will be able to take the pre-test (or in the case of the MCAT the provided test authorization code) home and complete it on their own time prior to the first day of classes. GRE and GMAT pre-tests are completed online with instructions given to students the week before classes begin.
         </div> </li> 
        <li>What should I do if I cannot attend every class? 
         <div class="xpander">
          If you are unable to attend every class, please e-mail your instructor for instructions on getting the information you missed. You can also visit the instructors if they have office hours. We do not give full or partial refunds to students who pay for the seminar and then do not attend every class, so please check your schedules before you register.
         </div> </li> 
        <li>Are there any circumstances under which I can get a refund? 
         <div class="xpander">
          Students who registered for a seminar that is later canceled due to low enrollment will either not be charged or will receive a full refund. If a seminar is not canceled, all fees paid are non-refundable, but the fee may be forwarded to a later seminar. For example, if due to unforeseen circumstances a student is unable to attend the seminars but has already registered, the student can transfer their registration and fees to a future seminar. We are not responsible for students who find they have a class conflict after they register for an ARC grad exam prep seminar, so please check your schedule and plan accordingly. Our instructors are paid for each course they teach and materials are purchased ahead of time, so if too many students drop, we would be unable to cover the operational costs of the program. A non-refundable fee allows us to keep costs as affordable as possible for UCR students.
         </div> </li> 
        <li>Do I need to take a graduate or professional school exam? 
         <div class="xpander">
          Before registering for any graduate or professional school exam preparation course, you need to find out if the program to which you want to apply requires a test score. While doctoral programs typically require a GRE score and professional schools require scores from their specified exams, many master’s degree programs do not require GRE scores. Some graduate programs give applicants a choice to submit either GRE scores or scores from another exam, but you must research the information by checking with the program to which you want to apply.

        <li>Is there parking available? 
         <div class="xpander">
          While there is parking on some local streets near UCR, we suggest purchasing a night permit from 
          <a href="http://parking.ucr.edu/"><span style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px; color: #541658;"><span style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border-bottom-width: 1px; border-bottom-style: dotted; border-bottom-color: #541658; background-color: #f2f5f8;">UCR's Transportation &amp; Parking Service</span></span><span style="color: #541658;"><span style="border-bottom-width: 1px; border-bottom-style: dotted; border-bottom-color: #541658; background-color: #f2f5f8;">s</span></span></a>. The current cost is $36 per 10-week quarter or 5-week summer session and can be used in any non-reserved space in a Gold, Blue, or Red parking lot AFTER 4PM. The cost for a daily permit in a Blue lot after 4PM is $5.50 ($9 for the full day). We suggest parking in 
          <a href="http://campusmap.ucr.edu/imap/index.html?loc=P24">Blue Lot 24</a> (click for location on the campus map) as it is closest to the 
          <a href="http://campusmap.ucr.edu/imap/index.html?loc=SURGE">Surge Building</a> in which the Academic Resource Center is located. Permits may be purchased 
          <a href="https://ebusiness.parking.ucr.edu/ebusiness/cmn/auth_ext.aspx">online</a> (use Guest Login) or in person at 
          <a href="http://campusmap.ucr.edu/imap/index.html?loc=PARKS">Transportation &amp; Parking Services</a> (click for location on the campus map). 
          <a href="http://wrc.ucr.edu/escortservices//index.html">UCR Campus Safety</a> also provides free escort services after dark to accompany you safely to your vehicle.
         </div> </li> 
        <li>Is there wifi or internet service available for those who are not UCR staff members or students? 
         <div class="xpander">
          UCR’s wifi through 
          <strong>mobilenet</strong> or 
          <strong>ucrwpa</strong> is not accessible unless you have an active UCR NetID. You may access 
          <strong>eduroam</strong> if you have an eduroam account from another institution. You may want to try contacting the institution where you received your bachelor’s degree to determine if they are part of the eduroam network and can give you access. You will need to configure your smartphone, tablet, or computer before you use eduroam. As a student in one of our grad exam prep seminars, you can access the internet through one of the thin client computers in the ARC Computer Lab. Ask our front desk to help you log on to one of the computers as a guest.
