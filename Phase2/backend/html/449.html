      <h3 id="intro"><strong>POLICIES APPLYING TO THE DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION FROM STUDENT RECORDS</strong></h3> 
      <br> 
      <h4>INTRODUCTION (Revised, 2007)</h4> 
      <p>The University of California, Riverside, maintains various types of records pertaining to the students; some are maintained for academic purposes, others, such as medical records, are maintained for other specific purposes. These policies apply only to records pertaining to students in their capacity as students; they are not applicable to other records which are maintained for purposes unrelated to a student's status as a student. The disclosure of information from student records is governed by the Federal Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA), and in part by the State of California Education Code. It is the purposes of these policies to provide reasonable interpretations of those laws and to protect the student's right of privacy as guaranteed by the Constitution of the State of California. When the law is silent, the University shall be guided by two principles: (1) the privacy of an individual is of great weight, and (2) the information in a student's file should be disclosed to the student on request. </p> 
      <p>These policies supersede the <em>University of California, Riverside Policies Applying to the Disclosure of Information from Student Records, </em>which were dated March 15, 1998. They supersede all previous policies and implement the<em><a href="http://policy.ucop.edu/doc/2710533/PACAOS-130" target="_blank">University of California Policies Applying to the Disclosure of Student Records</a>, </em>Section 130.00, in the <em><a href="http://policy.ucop.edu/doc/2710530/PACAOS-100" target="_blank">Policies Applying to Campus Activities, Organizations, and Students</a>,</em> issued August 15, 1994 (revised October 12, 2005) by the University of California, Office of the President, Office of Student Academic Services. They incorporate pertinent provisions of the State of California Education Code (Section 67110 et seq.), relating to student records and the requirements set forth in the regulations implementing the <a href="http://www.ed.gov/policy/gen/guid/fpco/ferpa/index.html" target="_blank">Federal Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act</a> dated April 11, 1988. </p>

      <h4 id="definitions">1.0 DEFINITIONS</h4> 
      <br> 
      <div class="num1-1"> 
       <h5 id="student">1.01 Student</h5> 
       <p>A "student" is an individual for whom the University of California, Riverside, maintains student records and who either: (a) is enrolled in or registered with an academic program of the University; or (b) is between academic terms and has completed the immediately preceding term and is eligible for reenrollment or is on approved educational leave or other approved leave status. </p> 
       <p>Because the University uses enrollment and registration rather than attendance as a measure of student status, the term "attendance" as used in the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act is synonymous with the term "enrolled in and registered with" as specified in these policies. </p> 
       <h5 id="record">1.02 Record</h5> 
       <p>"Record" means any information or data recorded in any medium including, but not limited to, handwriting, print, tapes, film, microfilm, microfiche, and any electronic storage or retrieval media. </p> 
       <h5 id="student records">1.03 Student Records</h5> 
       <div class="num1-1-1"> 
        <p><strong>1.03.1</strong> "Student records" are those records directly related to a student and maintained by the University of California, Riverside. </p> 
        <p><strong>1.03.2 </strong>Student records include, but are not limited to, academic evaluations, including student examination papers, transcripts, test scores and other academic records, general counseling and advising records, disciplinary records, and financial aid records, including student loan collection records. </p> 
        <p><strong>1.03.3 </strong>The term "student records" as used in these policies is synonymous with the term "education records" in the Federal Family Rights and Privacy Act. </p> 
        <p><strong>1.03.4 </strong>The term "student records" does not include the following records, and therefore such records are <strong>not</strong> governed by these policies. </p> 
        <div class="num1-1-1-a"> 
         <ol style="list-style: lower-alpha; list-style-position: outside;"> 
          <li>Personal records of instructional, supervisory, and administrative personnel and educational personnel ancillary to those persons, which: 
           <ol> 
            <li>Are kept by the sole possession of the maker of the record; and</li> 
            <li>Are not accessible or revealed to any other individual, except to an individual who performs on a temporary basis the duties of the individual who made the record. </li> 
           </ol> </li> 
          <li>Campus Police records which are created and maintained by the campus police solely for law enforcement purposes. </li> 
          <li>All records relating to a student who is also an employee of the University of California, Riverside, are included in the definition of student records, if the student's employment is contingent upon the fact that the individual is a student. For example, Federal Work-study records are student records.<br> Employment records, when the University of California, Riverside, employment did not result from and does not depend upon the fact that an individual is a student at the University, provided that the employment records: 
           <ol> 
            <li>Relate exclusively to the individual in that individuals capacity as an University employee; </li> 
            <li>Are made and maintained in the normal course of business; and</li> 
            <li>Are not available for use for any other purpose.</li> 
           </ol> </li> 
          <li>Health records which: 
           <ol> 
            <li>Are created or maintained by a physician, psychiatrist, psychologist, or other recognized professional or paraprofessional acting in a professional or paraprofessional capacity, or assisting in that capacity; </li> 
            <li>Are created, maintained, or used only in connection with the provision of the treatment of the student; and </li> 
            <li>Are not disclosed to anyone other than the individuals providing the treatment, except that records may be personally reviewed by a physician or other appropriate professional of the student's choice.<br> For the purpose of this definition, "treatment" does not include academic or career advising, tutoring, disability management counseling, or any instructions offered by the University of California, Riverside. </li> 
           </ol> </li> 
          <li>Applicant records of individuals who do not enroll in or register with an academic program of the University. If and when applicants become students, their applicant records become student records, which are then according the same privacy rights as any other student records governed by these policies. See <a href="#student"><strong>Section 1.01</strong></a> for definition of "student". </li> 
          <li>Alumni records or any records containing only information relating to a person after that person is no longer a student. </li> 
         </ol>

       <h5 id="personally">1.04 Personally Identifiable Information</h5> 
       <div class="num1-1-1"> 
        <p><strong>1.04.1 </strong>The term "personally identifiable information" means any information that identifies or describes a student. It includes, but is not limited to, a student's name, the name of a student's parent or other family members, the address of a student or student's family, any personal identifier such as a student's social security number, or any personal characteristics or other information that would make a student's identity easily traceable. </p> 
        <p><strong>1.04.2 </strong>Personally identifiable information is divided into two categories: (1) public information, which may be disclosed to any party without the prior written consent of the student to whom the information pertains, except as specified in <a href="#disclosure 3"><strong>Section 6.01</strong></a>, and (2) confidential information which requires the student's prior written consent, except as specified in <a href="#permissible"><strong>Section 7.01</strong></a>. </p>

         </ol> 
        </div> 
        <p><strong>1.05.3 </strong>Students have the right to refuse to permit any or all of the above categories of personally identifiable information to be designated as public information with respect to themselves.

Students who wish to exercise this right should also go to the Privacy section of their R'web account. </p> 
        <br> 
        <p><strong>1.05.4 </strong>The term "public information" as used in these policies is synonymous with the term "directory information" in the Federal Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act and the State of California Education Code. </p>

       <p>The term "disclosure" means to permit access to or the release, transfer, or other communication of personally identifiable information contained in a student record to any party, by any means, including, but not limited to, oral, written, or electronic means. </p>

      <p>In accordance with the Federal Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974 as amended and campus procedures that implement the University of California Policies Applying to the Disclosure of Information from Student Records, the following information is published. </p> 
      <p>The University of California, Riverside, considers the following to be public information with respect to individual students: addresses (local, permanent, e-mail addresses); telephone numbers; date and place of birth; major field of study; dates of attendance; number of enrolled units; degrees and honors received; the name of the most recent previous educational institution attended; participation in officially recognized university activities, including intercollegiate athletics; and the name, weight, and height of participants on intercollegiate university athletic teams. </p> 
      <p>Students have a right to refuse to permit any or all of the above categories of personally identifiable information to be designated as public information with respect to themselves. Students who do not want their information to be published in the campus directory must check the appropriate privacy restriction on <a href="http://www.rweb.ucr.edu" target="_blank">R'web.ucr.edu</a>. Students who wish to have any or all of the items defined as public information to be restricted from release outside the University must check each item to be restricted on <a href="http://www.rweb.ucr.edu" target="_blank">R'web.ucr.edu</a>. </p> 
      <p>Students who choose to restrict personally identifiable information about themselves that has been defined as public information are advised of some potential implications. The campus may not then disclose to anyone (including prospective employers, hometown newspapers, and others outside the University) information from a restricted category, such as the award of a Regents Scholarship, election to Phi Beta Kappa, degree(s) granted and the date(s) conferred, and dates of attendance. </p> 
      <p>Students' academic records are maintained in their academic department and appropriate college or school, or the Graduate Division; the maintenance of these records is the responsibility of the department chair or dean. Students who believe that their records contain incorrect or misleading information and who seek review of these records with a view towards altering or expunging a portion of them should make initial inquiry and petition through the appropriate department chair or academic dean, who institutes an informal investigation and, if necessary, refers the matter for hearing. </p> 
      <p>Copies of the University of California and UCR Policies Applying to Disclosure of Information from Student Records are available in the following offices on the UCR campus: Office of the Executive Vice Chancellor and Provost; Office of the Registrar; Office of the Vice Chancellor, Student Affairs; the Office of the Assistant Vice Chancellor of Enrollment Management; the Office of Enrollment Management Systems, and Office of the Ombudsman. These offices also have copies of the Federal Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974, as amended, for review. </p> 
      <p>Students have a right to file complaints with the Family Policy Compliance Office, U.S. Department of Education regarding alleged violations of the rights accorded them by the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974, as amended. Students are urged to bring to the attention of the UCR FERPA office or Registrar any problems or possible violations of rights associated with the Act. </p>
