     <h3>Application Fee<a name="Top of Page"> </a></h3> 
     <p>The <strong>nonrefundable $100.00 application fee</strong> (<strong>$125.00 for&nbsp;<strong>M.B.A./M.P.Ac./M.Fin./Flex M.B.A.</strong> applicants only</strong>) must be paid by credit card (VISA, MasterCard, or Discover) prior to submission of your application.</p> 
     <p>This fee is devoted to the administrative cost of processing an application, and is not refundable regardless of the outcome of an application.</p> 
     <p><strong>Do I qualify to apply as <a href="/Status_In_US.html">Domestic or International</a>?</strong></p> 
     <h3>Graduate Program Applications</h3> 
     <p>Graduate programs in some areas require specific program applications or supplements in addition to the Application for Graduate Admission. As applicants are expected to be aware of all requirements, please refer to Program Information for your proposed major for specifics</p> 
     <h3>Submitting Application Materials</h3> 
     <p><span style="color: #990000;"><strong>All required application materials (including transcripts) should be mailed to:</strong></span></p> 
     <p><br> <strong>Graduate Program in</strong> (<em>fill in program name to which you are applying</em><em>)</em> <br> University of California<br>900 University Avenue<br> Riverside, CA 92521 USA</p> 
     <h4>Transcripts<a name="InternationalTranscript"> </a></h4> 
     <p><span style="color: #990000;"><strong>It is very important that all transcripts be sent directly to the graduate program to which you are applying.&nbsp; If they are sent to the Graduate Admissions Office, the review of your application will be delayed.</strong></span></p> 
     <p>Applicants are required to submit an official copy of transcripts and degree certificates (in original language accompanied by certified English translations) from each academic institution attended <strong>after secondary school</strong>. These records should be sent directly <strong>from</strong> the Registrars Office of the academic institutions you have attended <strong>to</strong> <strong>the academic department to which you are applying</strong>. If this service is not available, applicants may also request official copies and send them in the institutions' original sealed and certified institution envelopes. Official records are original documents issued by the institution which bear the actual signature of the registrar in ink and the original wet ink stamp/seal of the issuing institution.&nbsp;The institution envelope must also bear that institution's appropriate authenticity indicator (original wet ink stamp and/or signature, etc.) from the appropriate department at that institution to consider the provided certified transcripts and degree certificates provided by the institution as official. Notarized documents are not acceptable. Credential evaluations by WES&nbsp;(World Education Services) or similar credential evaluation services are also not acceptable.<br> <br> All official academic records must be issued in the original language and accompanied by English translations prepared by the issuing institution. Specially prepared English versions are not acceptable in place of documents issued in the original language. If translations are not available from the institution itself, they may be prepared by government or official translators. For translations to be acceptable, they must bear the stamp or seal of the issuing institution or governmental agency and the original signature of the translator. They must be complete and exact word-for-word translations of the original documents, not interpretations. A photocopy of the original language documents (transcripts/degree certificates) used by the certified translator for the provided translations must also be included with the official translation by the certified translator. Grades must not be converted to a US scale. Records submitted for review may not be borrowed, photocopied, returned to you or sent elsewhere.</p> 
     <p>If you have attended an institution located in the U.S., please visit the <a href="/domestic.html">Transcripts</a> section of the Application Requirements for U.S. Citizens and Permanent Residents page for detailed document requirements.<br> <br> Please note that some US institutions have an electronic system of providing transcripts. This format is accepted for <strong>initial review purposes only</strong>. If an admitted applicant accepts our offer of admission a final official hard-copy transcript will be required from the institution's Office of the Registrar (not electronic format) before admission can be finalized.</p> 
     <h4>Statement of Purpose/Personal History Statement</h4> 
     <p>Applicants must submit these essays directly into their online application. Please note that each essay should not duplicate the other. We also do not accept a <em>personal resume</em> or <em>curriculum vitae</em> as a response to either essay.</p> 
     <p>The Statement of Purpose is your opportunity to state your specific interests with respect to the program to which you are applying. Your intended area of specialization, career objectives and research interests and experience are of particular interest.</p> 
     <p>The Personal History Statement is your opportunity to discuss how your personal background informs your decision to pursue a graduate degree. Please include any educational, familial, cultural, economic, or social experiences, challenges, or opportunities relevant to your academic journey; how you might contribute to social or cultural diversity within your chosen field; and/or how you might serve educationally underrepresented segments of society with your degree.</p> 
     <h4>Letters of Recommendation</h4> 
     <p>Applicants will be able to enter their recommenders' information directly into their electronic application. Recommenders will be notified electronically and provided instructions on how to submit a letter online. All letters of recommendation must be received electronically so they are attached to the applicants file for review.</p> 
     <p>Graduate programs require three (3) letters of recommendation. Submitting more than three letters does not improve your standing as an applicant. At least two of these letters should be requested from professors in your major subject. The most important aspect of letters of recommendation is that they be completed by individuals who are in a position to analyze your academic ability and potential for success in a rigorous graduate program. <span style="color: #17365d;">If you wish to submit a letter from an employer, please contact the graduate program advisor to determine if this will be acceptable</span>. Please note if you are applying to the M.P.Ac., M.Fin., M.B.A., and Flex M.B.A., letters from an employer are acceptable. <strong>All letters of recommendation must be in English.</strong> If you have been enrolled in a previous graduate program, it is required that one letter be from your research or program advisor in that graduate program.</p> 
     <p>Applicants using Interfolio's online portfolio service can have their letters uploaded to our online application using Interfolio's "Web Delivery" Method. To do so, please follow the step-by-step instructions located within the Reference Information section of the online application.<br> <br> If you wish to waive your right to inspect the letters of recommendation, mark the appropriate box below the reference information. Only enrolled UCR students are permitted to inspect letters of recommendation for which they did not waive their right to access. Letters of recommendation cannot be released to the applicant and cannot be forwarded elsewhere.</p> 
     <h4>The Graduate Record Examination</h4> 
     <p>The GRE general test is required of all applicants with the exceptions noted below. Some programs also require applicants submit scores from the Subject Test of the GRE. Consult the program to which you are applying for its requirements. Although current scores are preferred, some graduate programs will accept scores from tests taken within the last five years.&nbsp;</p> 
     <p>GRE scores from the General Test must be submitted for fellowship consideration. We strongly advise you to be aware of the deadline for the program to which you are applying. Dates and information for computer-based testing (CBT) may be obtained by contacting the Educational Testing Service (ETS) at the address below, by calling 1-800-GRE-CALL, or by consulting the <a href="http://www.gre.org/">GRE Web site</a>. Fellowship applicants should take the exam in time to meet the program deadline. Applicants should plan to take the GRE prior December to ensure the timely receipt of their test scores for admission consideration. Keep in mind that it may take up to four weeks for test scores to reach us from ETS.  Test Scores submitted may not be borrowed, photocopied, returned to you or sent elsewhere.</p> 
     <p>Applications for the GRE can be obtained from:</p> 
     <address>Educational Testing Service <br>PO Box 6000 <br>Princeton, NJ 08541-6000  </address> 
     <h5>Exceptions to the GRE Requirement </h5> 
     <p>&nbsp;</p> 
     <p>Creative Writing and Writing for the Performing Arts (MFA);Experimental Choreography (MFA); Visual Arts (MFA); and Education (MEd only) do not require the GRE exam.&nbsp;Applicant's applying to the Management&nbsp;(MBA and PHD), Flex&nbsp;MBA (MBA),&nbsp;Finance (MFIN), and Accounting, Auditing and Assurance (MPAC) may submit scores from the Graduate Management Admissions Test (GMAT) or the GRE exam.</p> 
     <p>Be sure to list the GRE institution code for UCR is 4839. GRE department and major codes can be found <a href="/GRE%2011_12_dept_major_field_codes.pdf">here</a> or by contacting prospective programs. If ETS has not assigned a major code to your proposed area of study, instruct them to send your score to your specific program.</p>
