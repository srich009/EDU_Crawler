       <p>The Career Center Peer Advisors are here to help you out with your professional development. We are here to support, assist, and provide guidance for students in drop-in advising, workshops, and information sessions—all of which are designed to encourage your exploration of the career and academic opportunities available to you. If you have any questions, you can find the peers at Career Station every Wednesday, or at the Career Center during regular hours. </p>

The Career Peers are here to help, and we hope to see you soon! </p>

        <p><span>I enjoy spending time with my friends and family, painting, going to the beach, watching movies and dancing. My passion is to help others, whether they are a friend or strangers, and I strive to encourage everyone around me to do what they love. I make it a point in my relationships with everyone to help believe in themselves. Overall I care about the people that are around mean try to have a positive influence on them. My professional goal is to become a counselor and work with children and their families to develop strong relationships.</span></p> 
        <p><span>The Career Center is providing me with many tools and resources that I need to start the search for opportunities that will help me to with my career growth. Whether you know or don’t know what you want to do with your degree or if you want to change your career goal, the Career Center can be a great resource to help you grow and investigate yourself and career. Before knowing all the resources and help offered at the career center I thought I wanted to be a pediatrician. However, I would be giving up the lifestyle I want, because it is a great way to help children. Even though true, I didn’t know the other ways I could help children without giving up my lifestyle. The Career Center helped me see the many different ways I could help children without giving anything and in ways that I love. So, please come into the Career Center and allow us to help you grow and get you going to a career you would love. Let yourself that chance to grow, experience, and to learn something that will help you one day make a great decision.</span></p>

I came to the States for the first time in my life right before college. Even though I have only been here for slightly over a year (as of December 2017), I have grown really attached to this place, my friends here, my job, and many other amazing opportunities.&nbsp; </p> 
        <p>I love hanging out with friends. travelling, anything fashion-related, making videos, writing and dancing. I aspire to make a positive impact on others’ lives — although I have yet to decide on the specific approach/career path. For now, I just love spreading positivity, offering support to those around me — be it emotional support as a friend, or professional support as a Peer Advisor at the Career Center.&nbsp; </p> 
        <p>I am excited about all the skills that I am to learn, the people whom I am to meet, the opportunities I am to come by, and even the challenges I am to encounter and eventually overcome!” </p>

        <p>I enjoy going to the gym, playing sports, traveling, and adventuring into the essence nature. As an ambitious undergraduate in pursuit of medical school, I am fascinated in how our brain influences our emotions, thought processes, and everyday behaviors. I aim to become a Neurologist who can treat disorders of the brain, spinal cord, and nerves. </p> 
        <p>The thing that I love most about working at the Career Center is knowing that at the end of the day, we are helping to make a difference. As a Peer Advisor, I am granted that opportunity to guide and assist students on their path towards success through hosting and aiding with workshops, career fairs, information sessions, and much more. </p> 
        <p>On top of the many resources and tools, there is much more to the Career Center than what meets the eye, and it is our staff. From career counselors to special program coordinators to employer relations, they are nothing short of amazing through their kindness, compassion, and dedication that they devote towards helping students succeed. </p> 
        <p>Whether you want to learn more about your career path, are unsure on how to write a resume, want to learn the keys to a successful interview, job searching, or are unsure of the steps to take after graduating, I encourage you to drop by our center, and we would be more than happy to help you out! </p>

        <p>My interests includes sports, YouTube, video games, and movies. My passion is to help others, friends or strangers, and be involved somehow through a positive way. I am determined to pursue a Master's in Business Administration. My professional goal is to hold a management position for a company, non-profit or for profit, that may offer opportunities for individuals to pursue a higher education.&nbsp; </p> 
        <p>My favorite aspect of working at the Career Center is the interaction between our staff and the students. Our staff genuinely care about career and graduate advancement for students. I am grateful to share this interaction with students as well because it furthers my professional growth and career interests. I want to help those who may not know about the available opportunities on-campus. If I could market these opportunities through media and promotion, then I believe it will benefit our student body.&nbsp; </p> 
        <p>I encourage every student on-campus to visit the Career Center at least once before they finish their time at UCR. You may be surprised at what you could discover while talking to our wonderful student employees or with our fantastic Career Center staff.&nbsp; </p> 
        <p>I am excited for what our students can achieve in the future. I hope to meet you all soon!<br><br><img src="../../images/Martin%20Website.png" alt="Martin B 1718" width="300" height="249"></p>

        <p>I am currently a third year student majoring in accounting. I love spending time with my friends, whether that is going to concerts, trying new food places, or spontaneous hangouts. I also enjoy watching sports, working out, and watching movies. My interest in accounting stems from the initial interest of learning how numbers on a financial sheet can reflect the performance of a company. I hope to work for a stable accounting firm as an auditor, and eventually becoming a university recruiter for my firm. My long-term goal will be to eventually move back to my hometown of San Francisco; a city that I grew up in my whole life that has shaped my personality and perspectives prior to coming to UCR.&nbsp; &nbsp; </p> 
        <p>My favorite part of working in the Career Center is being constantly surrounded by other talented and motivated peer advisors, as well as having the support of the staff that genuinely enjoy their job as well as helping me grow as an individual. I believe our group of Career Counselors and Peer Advisors are top notched in their knowledge of helping students grow professionally, and it makes me feel grateful that I can work alongside with them. What they teach me through our day to day interactions has helped me grow as a Peer Advisor, which enables me to provide the services and help to the students I interact with. The Career Center is such an important resource on campus, and being able to work here with the staff has made my experience enjoyable.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p> 
        <p>Whether it’s getting a resume revised right before a Career Fair with our drop-in services, getting tips for an interview, figuring out the next steps to take after graduation, or getting a tour of the Career Center, feel free to visit. We are here to help you grow professionally through our resources and services, and our staff is ready to help. Feel free to make a visit, and I hope to see you soon!<br><br><img src="../../images/Reggie%20Website.png" alt="Reginald W 1718" width="300" height="249"></p>

        <p>A famous Mexican proverb or dicho I like to live my life by is “El que madruga, Dios lo ayuda.” This proverb translates to “God helps those who rise early.” To many individuals this might not make any sense but, the message I believe this proverb tries to convey is that honest, hard work pays off. I chose to believe this because this proverb gives me hope. This makes me believe that if I continue to work hard, if I try to be a good person and help others along the way, then the universe will repay me with good karma.&nbsp; </p> 
        <p>I enjoy hanging out with my friends and family, watching Netflix, listening to a variety of music, trying new foods, and watching movies. I aspire to become a counselor or work in higher education because I truly enjoy working with students. As a first generation student and as the first member of my family to attend college, learning how to navigate college on my own was stressful and hard. However, I consider myself lucky because my challenges as a first generation student forced me to step out of my comfort zone and look for my school’s academic resources. Thanks to the help of teachers, mentors, and resource centers, I was able to successfully transition and adapt to a life here, at UCR.&nbsp; </p> 
        <p>This is why I believe resource centers, like the Career Center, are incredibly important. I love working as a Peer Advisor for the Career Center because the main focus of my job is to help UCR students with their professional and career needs. I encourage all UCR students, regardless of year or major, to stop by the Career Center and see how the Career Counselors and Peer Advisors can help you!<br><br><img src="../../images/Rosa%20Website.png" alt="Rosa Garcia 1718" width="299" height="250"></p>

        <p>I spend my free time meeting up with my friends, going to concerts, and watching movies. I aspire to become a Healthcare Executive and go to graduate school. My interest in going into the health sector has been shaped by learning about the health reform and policies that affect communities and people individually in various aspects in their life. Health is not just about treating an illness, it is about maintaining individuals’ health and becoming aware of the resources and other factors that contribute to the access of health care. </p> 
        <p>Being a Peer Advisor has been a rewarding experience in allowing me to share knowledge that was once given to me when I began using Career Center services. The Career Center has given me the tools and resources I need to begin my search and improvement in personal and career growth. These are resources and experiences I’ll carry with me as I plan to help patients in the health industry and continue to share with students today. </p>
